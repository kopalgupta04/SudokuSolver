## README

This repository contains a Java-based Sudoku game that uses the backtracking algorithm to check the solutions input by the user for a random valid Sudoku puzzle. It also contains a sudoku solver for checking getting the answers of a sudoku puzzle
The solver efficiently fills in the 9x9 grid by recursively trying possible numbers and backtracking when a conflict is detected. It's designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the power of backtracking in solving constraint satisfaction problems. 

Feel free to clone, modify, and explore the code!
